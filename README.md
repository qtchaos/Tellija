Tellija is a Discord bot that I made for fun, it'll send the latest news from Postimees in a simple embed.

## Commands
Currently you have to type the **!latest** command in the channel you want news to be sent to, I'll try to implement something better soon.

## Installation
This assumes you already have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed.
```
git clone https://github.com/qtchaos/Postimees-Bot.git
cd postimees
// Create a file named '.env' and place your token inside like so: TOKEN="<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run command: ``python main.py``
